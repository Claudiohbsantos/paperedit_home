import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

1. Click <img alt="import button" src={useBaseUrl('imgs/import_btn.png')} /> to choose a local file to play.
2. Play/Pause audio using the Transport Toolbar above the editor.
3. Click <img alt="import button" src={useBaseUrl('imgs/timestamp.png')} /> to insert a timestamp. Follow the timestamp with the transcribed text of the segment.

## Editing the Transcript

Most of what you expect to work on a text editor such as Word or Google Docs should work on PaperEdit.

You can use [Keybindings](src-keybindings) such as [ctrl+b] to make your text bold, or you can select a portion of text and style it using the popup menu:


<img alt="Editor Popup" src={useBaseUrl('imgs/editor_popup.png')} />

You can find 2 buttons in the top left toolbar that will assist you with transcript editing:

- <img alt="import button" src={useBaseUrl('imgs/hide_strikes_btn.png')} /> - Make striked sections barely visible so you can focus on the text that has not been cut out yet.
- <img alt="import button" src={useBaseUrl('imgs/timestamp.png')} /> - Insert the current audio playback position as a timestamp.

## Playing Audio Files

PaperEdit can play audio files located in your computer. To do so you can always click <img alt="import button" src={useBaseUrl('imgs/import_btn.png')} /> and select **Choose Audio** to choose a new file to play.

### Controlling Playback

<img alt="Audio Toolbar" src={useBaseUrl('imgs/audio_toolbar.png')} />

Playback can be controlled via the transport buttons on top of the editor or using [Keybindings](keybindings)

### Skip Striked Sections

You can automatically skip cut sections during playback by enabling the <img alt="import button" src={useBaseUrl('imgs/skip_striked.png')} /> button on the toolbar. To the left of the button you can also see how long the edited audio currently is.

## What is a Paper Edit?

In the video and podcast industries editing a piece often starts with pen and paper instead of a timeline. Well, maybe not pen and paper anymore, but on a text edititing software. Producers work with transcripts of long interviews or speeches and make their first rough cut of content looking at just the words. That "paper cut" is then often sent to an editor who will then go back to the original footage and will manually follow the producers paper cut to remove segments of the footage until they have a cut that matches the producer's choices.

The biggest problem with this workflow is that much of it is redundant. Since the producer is often working off of a transcription document, they already have time information that can be used to make the cuts. Instead spending time "catching up" to the producer's work, and editor should be able to start working exactly from where the paper cut ended, polishing edits and making selections without having to manually type in timecodes.

The producer is often working blind in a manner as well. If they are aiming to have a 15 minute cut out of an hour of footage, they must use their experience and a whole lot of estimating to guess how long their paper cut will be. PaperEdit can tell you exactly how long your cut currently is at any point simply by using the timestamps from the transcript.

PaperEdit empowers producers to hear their papercut as they edit, being completely in control of the length of their edit and what segments they want to include. Being primarily a text editor, PaperEdit can be searched, highlighted, bolded and striked with very intuitive tools that allow for great organization.

And what's even better: PaperEdit can export to a variety of plain text structured formats so the paper cut can be fed straight into your custom workflow. It can even create a [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) project so you can move straight from paper cutting into sound editing with absolutely no extra steps. 

It works entirely inside your browser and never sends any data to any servers anywhere. Your content is your business and I'll never know what you're using it for.

## What can't Paper Edit do?

PaperEdit was created for a simple necessity and does not attempt to replace a DAW or NLE in the editing workflow. PaperEdit can't and will never be able to:

- Fade cuts
- Re-arrange segments on the timeline
- Process the audio with VSTs or any kind of signal processing.

It is meant to help you cut content out using a text editor. That's it.

This app would never have been finished if I couldn't work on the foundations set by many other great services and projects. These are some of the projects that made PaperEdit possible.

### Open Source Projects

- Audio Playback and Waveform - [Wavesurfer](https://wavesurfer-js.org/)
- Text Editing - [Quill](https://quilljs.com/)
- Offline capability - [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- Building - [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)

### Hosting 

After trying many alternatives for simple and free hosting, [Render](https://render.com/) managed to meet all the requirements of the project and more while also being extremely straight forward to set-up. Most other options were either simple and non-performant or too complex for the needs of a simple static website.

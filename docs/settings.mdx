See [Time Input](settings#time-input) for details on format.

## Export Settings

### Time format for text exports

Controls how the timestamps will be exported on CSV and JSON exports.

- Seconds: ss
- Timestamp: hh:mm:ss
- Timecode: hh:mm:ss:ff

### Framerate

Framerate to be used when using timecode for time input on [Export Time Offset](settings#export-time-offset) or [Skip Length](settings#skip-length) settings.

### Export Time Offset

Offset to be added to timestamps on CSV or JSON exports.

## Time Input

Can be provided in several formats:

- hh:mm:ss
- ss
- hh:mm:ss:ff

PaperEdit will attempt to extract numbers from the input, considering anything other than a digit to be a separator. 121 seconds can be written in any of the following forms:

```
121
00:02:1
02:01
2 1
2.1
2m1s
0 0 121
```

Numbers are not limited to 2 digits and must not obey time formatting conventions. If you wish to input 70 minutes and 2 seconds you can write `00:70:02` and PaperEdit will make the necessary conversions internally.

As seen above, leading 0s can be ommited as long as frames are not being provided. However, if you wish to provide frames then all fields (hh:mm:ss:ff) must be provided:

```
With 24fps as framerate:

00 01 00 12 = 60.5 seconds
01 00 12 = 3612 seconds
```

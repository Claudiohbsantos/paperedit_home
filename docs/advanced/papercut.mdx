title: Papercut Format
---

Selecting **Save Project** in the Export menu allows you to save a Papercut (.ppcut) file containing the current transcript. This file is in reality just a JSON file containing an Object with the following properties:

- delta - Object representing a [Quill Delta](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/). 
- audioFile - String containing name of audio file being used. It is only used to hint the user towards what was the last file used while editing.
- title - String containing name of project.

```json title="papercut_template.ppcut"
{
  'delta': {},
  'audioFile': '',
  'title': ''
}
```
